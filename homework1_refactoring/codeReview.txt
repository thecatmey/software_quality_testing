Code review

Meaningful Names:
X Package Name is too generic and lacking modules
	Add modules and change name to the name of the exercise (homework1)
X Some method names do not describe their functionality properly
	Use names that follow naming conventions and properly convey the functionality of the method    
X Variable names are not descriptive enough in some cases (eg. rate/ value)
	Replace the variable names with more descriptive ones

Functions:
X Method calculalte is too generic and fullfils to tasks (calculating interest and calculating broker's fee)
	Simplify the method calculate by splitting it up into two functions and adding a third one that combines the two

Formatting:
X Variable and method names should ALL be camelCase
	Correct all the names
X Clean code rules for spaces are not regarded
	Correct all the spaces
X Placement of curly brackets is inconsistent
	Unify the placement of curly brackets
X Constructor should follow right after the declaration of the variables
	Place the constructor at the beginning of the class
X Some of the lines were longer than they should be
	Split up lines that are too long
X Inconsistent use of this
	Add this. for all the necessary variables to make it more obvious when the object variable is used

Comments: 
X Comments are unnecessary in refactored code bc the methods fulfil their desired functionality and are descriptive enough
	Instead of explaining the calculate method with a comment, it got a descriptive name
X To ensure that method getMonthlyRate exists in all classes an interface/ inheritance should be used
	Instead of the comment, the interface automatically forces devs to implement the method
Exceptions:
X Exception for setValue should express more clearly what the error is
	Include a new Exception InvalidValueException

Classes and Interfaces:
X The variables are public with get and set methods
	Make the variables private
X Broker's fee should be modifiable in another place
	Define a default value in the object and then implement a setter method in order to adapt the fee if needed

General Programming:
X Name of to_string doesn't override of the standard method (incorrectly written)
	Write the method name according to convention
X Useless variable
	Delete useless variables
X Methode print() is useless, bc I can find out anytime what type an object is (YAGNI)
	Delete the method
X daysActive is never assigned
	Assign a value for daysActive and provide a setter to change the value 
	(Additionally a counter to count the days since the activation of the account could be added)

Enums and Annotations
X Standard variables should be avoided 
	The standard values for the Account should be defined in an enum


Optional:
- STANDARD/ BUDGET are not used at all in this class (maybe they will be used for other applications)
	Normally I would delete values that won't be used. However, as STANDARD and BUDGET are now enumerates they might be needed in other applications.
	In that case I would check for other dependencies on the enums before deleting
