Code review

1. Code structure & naming conventions
X Package Name is too generic and lacking modules
X Variable and method names should ALL be camelCase
X Clean code rules for spaces are not regarded
X Some method names do not describe their functionality properly
    X name of to_string doesn't override of the standard method
X Inconsistent use of this
X Constructor should follow right after the declaration of the variables
X Useless variable
X Placement of curly brackets is inconsistent
X Comments are unnecessary in refactored code bc the methods fulfil their desired functionality and are descriptive enough
X Variable names are not descriptive enough in some cases (eg. rate/ value)
X Some of the lines were longer than they should be

2. Implementation
X Broker's fee should be modifiable in another place
X The standard values for the Account should be defined in an enum
X Exception for setValue should express more clearly what the error is
X To ensure that method getMonthlyRate exists in all classes an interface/ inheritance should be used
X The variables are public with get and set methods. Better to make them private
X daysActive is never assigned
X Methode print() is useless, bc I can find out anytime what type an object is (YAGNI)

3. Single Responsibility
X Simplify the method calculate by splitting it up into two functions



Optional:
- STANDARD/ BUDGET are not used at all in this class (maybe they will be used for other applications)
